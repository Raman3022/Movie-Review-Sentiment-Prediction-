# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Prediction-

# End-to-End Deep Learning Project using RNN

# Project Overview

This project implements a movie review sentiment analysis model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with bidirectional layers. The model predicts whether a movie review is positive or negative based on text input. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

# The model is constructed using the following layers:

Embedding Layer: Converts input words into dense vector representations.

Bidirectional SimpleRNN Layer: Captures long-term dependencies from both past and future context.

Dropout Layers: Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

Dense Output Layer: Uses a sigmoid activation function to produce binary classification output.


# System Configuration

This model was trained on the following system configuration:

Operating System: Windows 11 Home Single Language 64-bit

Processor: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13620H (16 CPUs)

Memory: 16GB RAM

Nvedia GPU RTX 4050 Memory - 13964

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a deep learning model using RNNs for sentiment analysis. The use of bidirectional layers helps capture contextual meaning effectively, leading to improved predictions.
